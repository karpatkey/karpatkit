    Renames files in the specified directory based on the provided name mapping.

    Parameters:
        directory (str): The path to the directory containing the files to rename.
        name_mapping (dict): A dictionary where keys are the current filenames and values are the new filenames.

    This function iterates over the items in `name_mapping`, constructs full file paths, and renames the files if 
    they exist in the specified directory. It prints a message for each successful rename and a warning if a file 
    is not found.
